# Release Notes

Welcome to AtomVM `@ATOMVM_VERSION@`

These release notes provide information about the current release of AtoVM.

## Required Software

The following software is required to develop Erlang or Elixir applications on AtomVM:

* The [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) program, for flashing the AtomVM image and AtomVM programs;
* An [Erlang/OTP](https://erlang.org);
* The [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) runtime, if developing Elixir applications;
* A serial console program, such as `minicom` or `screen`, so that you can view console output from your AtomVM application.
* (recommended) For Erlang programs, [`rebar3`](https://rebar3.org);
* (recommended) For Elixir programs, [`mix`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html), which ships with the Elixir runtime;

AtomVM will run BEAM files that have been compiled using the following Erlang and Elixir versions:

| Erlang Version | Elixir Version |
|----------------|----------------|
| OTP 22 | TODO |
| OTP 23 | TODO |
| OTP 24 | TODO |
| OTP 25 | TODO |

> Note.  Not all BEAM instructions are supported for every Erlang and Elixir compiler.  For details about which instructions are supported, see the `src/libAtomVM/opcodes.h` header file in the  [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/) github repository corresponding to the current release.

For detailed information about features and bug fixes in the current release, see the AtomVM [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md).
