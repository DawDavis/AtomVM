# Release Notes

Welcome to AtomVM `@ATOMVM_VERSION@`

These release notes provide information about the current release of AtoVM.

## Required Software

The following software is required to develop Erlang or Elixir applications on AtomVM:

* The [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) program, for flashing the AtomVM image and AtomVM programs to ESP32 MCUs.
* An [Erlang/OTP](https://erlang.org) compiler (`erlc`)
* The [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) runtime, if developing Elixir applications.
* A serial console program, such as `minicom` or `screen`, so that you can view console output from your AtomVM application.
* (recommended) For Erlang programs, [`rebar3`](https://rebar3.org)
* (recommended) For Elixir programs, [`mix`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html), which ships with the Elixir runtime.

AtomVM will run BEAM files that have been compiled using the following Erlang and Elixir versions:

| Erlang Version | Elixir Version |
|----------------|----------------|
| ✅ OTP 21 | ✅ 1.7 |
| ✅ OTP 22 | ✅ 1.8 |
| ✅ OTP 23 | ✅ 1.11 |
| ✅ OTP 24 | ✅ 1.14 |
| ✅ OTP 25 | ✅ 1.14 |
| ✅ OTP 26* | ✅ 1.15* |

`*` OTP 26 is still a release candidate and should be considered experimental.
Other versions of Elixir that are compatible with a particular OTP version may work, this chart reflects the versions that are tested.

> Note.  Not all BEAM instructions are supported for every Erlang and Elixir compiler.  For details about which instructions are supported, see the `src/libAtomVM/opcodes.h` header file in the  [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/) github repository corresponding to the current release.

### ESP32 Build requirements

This is entirely optional, you may simply use the downloadable images and flash them to your esp32 using `esptool`, but if you wish to work on development of the VM or use one on the additional drivers that are available in the ([AtomVM repositories](https://github.com/atomvm)) you will need a compatible version of ([Espressif's](https:/espressif.com)) ESP-IDF.
Espressif provides excellent installation documentation on their website at:
```
     https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.4/esp32/get-started/index.html
```

AtomVM currently supports the following versions of ESP-IDF:

| Espressif supported versions | AtomVM support |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| ESP-IDF v4.2 | ✅ |
| ESP-IDF v4.3 | ✅ |
| ESP-IDF v4.4 | ✅ |
| ESP-IDF v5.0 | ❌ |

> Support is planned for version 5.0...

For detailed information about features and bug fixes in the current release, see the AtomVM [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md).
